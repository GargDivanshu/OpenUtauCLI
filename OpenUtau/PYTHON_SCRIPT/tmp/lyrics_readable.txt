Tim you are a star,
you chase the clouds away,
Moments spent with you,
brighten up my day.
Your kindness is a gift,
you stand out from the crowd.
So heres a card for you,
now sing it loud and proud.
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride "in a"
one horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
hereâ€™s to Tim a
happy holiday!
